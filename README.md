# ncFN

**ncFN** is a novel and comprehensive framework for **ncRNA function annotation** based on a global, heterogeneous biomolecular network.  
The network consists of **29,676 nodes** and **565,482 edges**, integrating diverse molecular interactions.  
ncFN applies the **Random Walk with Restart (RWR)** algorithm to compute the **Association Strengths (ASs)** between each ncRNA and all protein-coding genes (PCGs).  
Subsequently, **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** is performed using ASs as input to annotate ncRNA functions.

## Key Features
- Calculate association scores between ncRNAs and PCGs  
- Perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)  
- Identify significantly enriched biological pathways  
- Visualize ncRNA-associated pathways
