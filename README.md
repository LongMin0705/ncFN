# ncFN
ncFN, a novel and comprehensive framework for ncRNA function annotation based on a global and heterogeneous biomolecular network. The network includes 29,676 nodes and 565,482 edges composed by diverse interactions. The Random Walk with Restart algorithm is performed to calculate the Association Strengths (ASs) of one ncRNA to all PCGs. Finally, ncRNA function is annotated via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with ASs as input.

## What can ncFN do
* Calculating gene association scores of ncRNA
* Performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
* Identifying significantly enriched pathways
* Visualizing ncRNA associated pathways
